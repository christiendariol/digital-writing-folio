## Reflection
I find this stuff really interesting in the context of the Oulipo works we’ve briefly looked at. The N+7 procedure was invented by John Lescure in 1961, and involves replacing nouns in a text with seventh one following in the dictionary. While this took a while to wrap my head around, I found it to be a pretty neat little device for playing around with language. My favourite part of writing is getting the opportunity to experiment with writing, and there’s something about an experiment that’s done in such a mathematical way is so intriguing to me. To take the idea of a piece of creative, experimental literature and turn it into kind of a mathematical equation is inherently a bit of joke, in a good way. I talked about ‘35 Variation on a Theme From Shakespeare’ in my other reflection as a work I really liked, and it has similarities. While I don’t see much ongoing potential in this idea, in terms of either the folio or something I would pursue long-term, there’s a lot I really like about it. I think it’s more the concept itself than the end result that fascinates me.
