# Simple Website Practice

## Reflection
A very basic website again, just getting a handle on the basic of html web design, in terms of heading structures, inputting text, fonts, italics and bold lettering. It also experimented with classes and ids, something I feel will be useful for differentiating lines of text and applying different effects to them. At this point is just about getting a guage of whether I can feasibly learn the basic of web design in the somewhat limited time we have. While there’s still a lot to learn, it doesn seem like I could wrap my head around enough of it to put together some basic web pages. I’m just hoping that I’m able to be as creative as I can with this, although I realise I’ll be naturally held back by the limitations of the platform and my own inexperience, I feel like I can learn enough in the time we have.
