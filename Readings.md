### Poetic Playlands

- Highlights the challenge of poetic games between reception and interaction "a receptive and interactive clash" (p. 124). This rang true for my own experiences of interactive electronic literature in general, especially examples that played out as a game. There is a dissonance between the presentation of complex literature that requires "deep attentive close reading" and being able to effectively engage with the actual game aspect. It's like working two different parts of the brain at the same time. 
- The discussion of challenging the user experience also reminded me of the Emerson reading ("Indistinguishable from Magic") from week 3, which discussed how digital literature opens up user interfaces and exposes underlying software in a way that's often hidden or obscured.
