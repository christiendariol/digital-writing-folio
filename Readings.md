### Enlightening Interactive Fiction : Andrew Plotkinâ€™s Shade
Although I was pleased to know that 'Shade' was intended to be deliberately obtuse and difficult to navigate, I still found it difficult to engage meaningfully with the work. I feel that I need more exposure to Interactive Fiction to then get something out of a creative experiment with the form. Its definitely a piece I enjoy reading about than actually engaging with myself. As the Douglass reading points out, its a piece thats appropriate for classrooms given its short length, highly conceptual nature and the availability (and readability) of the code. A key source of frustration in the piece was the constant brick walls the player comes up against, such not being able to turn on the lamp, or the shower or sink. Douglass (p. 3) brings attention to the language of the error messages the player recieves. "You do not want the dark" when trying to turn off the lamp highlights the limits to the characters world, and how theyre used not just to inform the player that they have comes against an unplayable aspect of the game, but also to provide insight into the psychological state of the main character.

### Kissing the Steak: The Poetry of Text Generators

I initially found it very difficult to wrap my head around the concept of text generators as the reading portrayed them. I had to go and do my own research into 'Syntext' and its authors for more context. It was really only after getting to practice with remixes in class that I felt like I understood the concept of it. This was an enlightening experience all round, as I think my initial confusion around the idea reflected how new and different this form was. I'm excited about the possibilites of this form and what meanings it can impart. The reading was quite dense in this regard, but I enjoyed its analysis of how 'Syntext' worked to "deconstruct human language to find new meanings" (p. 77). I'm a big fan of language deconstructions and experimentations, and this opens up many opportunities to play with language and text generation that id never previously thought of.

### Indistinguishable from Magic: Invisible Interfaces and Digital Literature as Demystifier

## Week 7

### Poetic Playlands

- Highlights the challenge of poetic games between reception and interaction "a receptive and interactive clash" (p. 124). This rang true for my own experiences of interactive electronic literature in general, especially examples that played out as a game. There is a dissonance between the presentation of complex literature that requires "deep attentive close reading" and being able to effectively engage with the actual game aspect. It's like working two different parts of the brain at the same time. 
- The discussion of challenging the user experience also reminded me of the Emerson reading ("Indistinguishable from Magic") from week 3, which discussed how digital literature opens up user interfaces and exposes underlying software in a way that's often hidden or obscured. 

### The Paradox of Poetic Gaming

- The line about "the poet cannot determine the exact path each player/reader will take" really interests me. The idea that with digital poetry like Nelson's, thre is so much fluidity regarding pace, rhythm, structure etc,. things that are fundamental elements of poetic construction. It does reach a point for me where I'm actually not sure whether I can consider his work truly 'poetry', if there is so much that is decided by the user. 

## Week 9

### Excavating Logics of White Supremacy in Electronic Literature

Ikeda's analysis was a highly inciteful take on the nature of algorithms as "cultural gatekeeper(s)". I've always been interested in the way that technology and digital entertainment has been shaped by unconcious processes and the way it has carried in societal baggage like the track marks of a muddy shoe brought into the house. The piece challenges strongly held beliefs about the purported 'objectivity' of database and search engines. As Ikeda calls it, there is a "postracial fantasy of colorblindness" within the tech industry. This colourblindness often manifests as the erasure of non-white identities and the reinforcement of societal norms.
