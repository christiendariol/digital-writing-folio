### What types of writing do you do?

- Non fiction 
- Essays
- Fiction

### What tools or techniques do you use to write?

- Usually pen and paper
- I like to write out in public somewhere, such as in a park, cafe or while riding the train

### Why do you use these tools (or techniques)?

- Pen and paper gives me a more intimate connection to my thoughts, and I find I'm better able to formulate sentences and my ideas on the page. Its also helpful if im trying anything more experimental, such as playing with format and layout, I can just write exactly what Im picturing in my head.
- Pen and paper is also easier for writing on the go, i dont need to carry around a laptop wherever I go in case i get an idea.
- Writing in public is usually just a result of being in an active state of mind, and more in a mood to get things done.

### How do these tools shape the way you write, e.g., constrain the way you write or facilitate your writing?

- Writing with pen and paper helps me be less critical of what I'm writing, i can write in a more immediate, intuitive way rather than overanalysing things. It helps to not have constant feedback like word count, number of pages and paragraphs, its more ambiguous so i can just focus on what im writing in the moment
- Writing out in public also assists in getting out of my head. I find writing while travelling especially stimulating as there is this constant sense of movement. 
- However, these can all come with their problems, and occasionally it is better to write on a computer or in a more private setting. This is especially true during editing, as that process requires a clearer mind and more concentration. There are also times when writing with a word processor can still allow me to write intuitively, it really depends. Occasionally the level of distraction that a public setting provides can be too much to really focus.
- I generally like to make use of all the tools at my disposal, and am always open to writing in different contexts, with different methods and using different approaches. 
- When experimenting with format, such as page size, font changes or different styles, a word processor can help me to realise these ideas in a more concrete way, so pen and paper can often constrain this type of experimentation.
