# Exercises

## Week 1

- [x] Create a GitHub account
- [x] Do the GitHub 'Hello World'
- [x] Add a repository for the folio
- [x] What types of writing do you do (ie fiction, nonfiction, poetry, other)
- [x] What tools or techniques do you use to write?
- [x] Why do you use these tools (or techniques)?
- [x] How do these tools shape the way you write, e.g., constrain the way you write or facilitate your writing?

### What types of writing do you do?

- Non fiction 
- Essays
- Fiction

### What tools or techniques do you use to write?

- Usually pen and paper
- I like to write out in public somewhere, such as in a park, cafe or while riding the train

### Why do you use these tools (or techniques)?

- Pen and paper gives me a more intimate connection to my thoughts, and I find I'm better able to formulate sentences and my ideas on the page. Its also helpful if im trying anything more experimental, such as playing with format and layout, I can just write exactly what Im picturing in my head.
- Pen and paper is also easier for writing on the go, i dont need to carry around a laptop wherever I go in case i get an idea.
- Writing in public is usually just a result of being in an active state of mind, and more in a mood to get things done.

### How do these tools shape the way you write, e.g., constrain the way you write or facilitate your writing?

- Writing with pen and paper helps me be less critical of what I'm writing, i can write in a more immediate, intuitive way rather than overanalysing things. It helps to not have constant feedback like word count, number of pages and paragraphs, its more ambiguous so i can just focus on what im writing in the moment
- Writing out in public also assists in getting out of my head. I find writing while travelling especially stimulating as there is this constant sense of movement. 
- However, these can all come with their problems, and occasionally it is better to write on a computer or in a more private setting. This is especially true during editing, as that process requires a clearer mind and more concentration. There are also times when writing with a word processor can still allow me to write intuitively, it really depends. Occasionally the level of distraction that a public setting provides can be too much to really focus.
- I generally like to make use of all the tools at my disposal, and am always open to writing in different contexts, with different methods and using different approaches. 
- When experimenting with format, such as page size, font changes or different styles, a word processor can help me to realise these ideas in a more concrete way, so pen and paper can often constrain this type of experimentation.


## Week 2

### Defining Electronic Literature

#### What elements of the works ("Taroko Gorge", "The Gathering Cloud", "First Draft of the Revolution", and "Shade") do you read?

Taroko Gorge: Descending, generated text that goes on infinitely. 

The Gathering Cloud: A series of poems integrated with various moving images that overlap with and interact with the words on the page. Hovering your mouse over certain words prompts a text box to appear. 

First draft of the revolution: Interactive hyperlink story that requires you to choose specific options to keep the narrative moving. 

Shade: Interactive fiction piece where you input commands to continue the story. The 'correct' commands are often non-obvious and take a lot of trial and error to figure out. 

#### How are those elements meaningful?

These elements have a varying degree of interactivity, ranging from Taroko Gorge with plays out automatically without any real input from the reader, to Shade, which requires not only constant input but a lot of thought and effort to conclude the story. These cross a wide spectrum of what can be considered "electronic literature", and raises questions about the loose definitions of the genre. 

Taroko Gorge: The falling texts signifies natural imagery of waterfalls or falling leaves, and the random generative nature of the text invokes a somewhat 'natural' feel to the poem, as though your discovering these unique words out in the wilderness. 

The Gathering Cloud: The piece, although technically a coherent poem that can be read in a straightforward fashion from start to finish, is constantly interrupting your reading. The moving and overlaping imagery, the prompts of text boxes, and the general messiness of the page makes it very difficult to focus on one thing at a time. This communicates a feeling of instability, of constant movement and change. It reflects a rapidly changing world that is moving to quickly for us make sense of much of it, and constaintly feels out of our control.

First draft of the revolution: The mechanic of having to alter the text of letters, accompanied by the character's inner thoughts, as a requirement to move the story forward, put the player into the mindset of the characters. Similar to Shade, there is a frustration that is created by being forced to constantly click through options to progress the game. It's also similar to The Gathering Cloud, in that it's constantly interupting our reading and intruding on any kind of natural flow. This makes sense given the context of the story, as it's about creating a 'draft', and represents the instability and uncertainty the characters are currently facing.  

Shade: The game is notoriously frustrating, especially for those inexperienced with interactive fiction. It induces feelings of entrapment, confusion and anger. This is reflected in the game's ending, wherein the main character was basically doomed from the beginning. 

#### How are the works read differently from print literature?

- Higher degree of interactivity
- Pace and timing is often decided for us, for instance in Taroko Gorge where there is a constant rhythm with which we are presented with each line. 
- Not having any physical sense of how long a piece is, or what shape it's going to take. Especially for something like Shade, it's very difficult to know how long the actual piece is going to be. 
- Rarely a straightforward path to read/experience the piece, each guides its audience on non-conventional or even randomly generated routes through the story. 

#### How is electronic literature different from print literature?

This is a difficult question, as there is hardly a throughline between different electronic pieces to connect each of them together. Interactivity is an obvious one, but there is also randomness, as well as some sort of visual element that plays out on the screen. Other than that, I believe that the act of putting something on a computer screen and calling it electronic literature in itself says something, it creates an act of electronic literature by it declaring itself so. Similar to Marcel Duchamp placing a urinal in an art gallery is in itself saying something about the nature of the work, and the nature of art. 

#### What are the qualities of the works we might consider as qualities of electronic literature

- Randomness
- User interaction
- Visual movement on the screen
- Lack of clear boundaries or indications of scale 

### Constraint and Process

#### Create a constraint (a restriction on your writing such as not using the letter "e" or a set number of syllables)


#### Create a process (a process for creating writing such as picking the third word of each page of a book)

### Taroko Gorge(s)

Select a remixed [Taroko Gorge](https://nickm.com/taroko_gorge/) and edit the `exercises.md` page in your digital writing folio and add the following questions with your answers to the questions:

- What aspects of the remix are the same?
- What aspects of the remix are different?
- Is the remix successful (why or why not)?


## Week 5

### Writing Hypertext Fiction
- How is it different from fiction?
It's functionally different in that it requires choices to be made by the reader to influence narrative outcomes. These outcomes may be meaningful or not (such as in Depression Quest), but the fact that the reader is being given the option in the first place to make decisions re-orientates the focus of the reader. 
- How is it different from games?
There isn't necessarily a challenge or puzzle to be solved, and there may not be a likelihood of failure, at which point you'd have to go back and start again. 
- How do you plan fiction?
Finding an image, scene or character that I find interesting and finding a way to present that in an interesting way. This will naturally bring up further ideas and characters. From then it's a process of following the path of least resistance in where the story would go beyond that point. At some point I would need to find a direction/ending for the story. 
- How could you plan hyptertext fiction?
Probably in a similar fashion, start with an idea or character and begin writing. It'd probably be easier to just try and write a story from start to finish, then go back and think about how different parts of the story could go differently. Then re-writing the same story with those altogether. 


## Week 10

### Who is the audience for your developed creative work?

Being centred around Melbourne's tram network, the intended audience will be cross between Melbournians interested in their city, and those interested by public transport/trams. The former will be the more prominent audience, making my piece quite localised. 

### How does having an audience in mind affect the development of your work?

This will allow me to develop distinct themes and focuses out of the work. At the moment, my piece is a little broad in its thematic meaning, and I hope to gradually narrow in on specifics as the it's development further.
