### What tools or techniques do you use to write?

- Usually pen and paper
- I like to write out in public somewhere, such as in a park, cafe or while riding the train

### How do these tools shape the way you write, e.g., constrain the way you write or facilitate your writing?

- Writing with pen and paper helps me be less critical of what I'm writing, i can write in a more immediate, intuitive way rather than overanalysing things. It helps to not have constant feedback like word count, number of pages and paragraphs, its more ambiguous so i can just focus on what im writing in the moment
- Writing out in public also assists in getting out of my head. I find writing while travelling especially stimulating as there is this constant sense of movement. 
- However, these can all come with their problems, and occasionally it is better to write on a computer or in a more private setting. This is especially true during editing, as that process requires a clearer mind and more concentration. There are also times when writing with a word processor can still allow me to write intuitively, it really depends.
- I generally like to make use of all the tools at my disposal, and am always open to writing in different contexts, with different methods and using different approaches.
