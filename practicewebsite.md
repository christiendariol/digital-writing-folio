## Reflection
This was experimenting with a very basic website, and some simple text. Unfortunately, there was quite a bit here that I wasn't able to get to work, but I understood the basic concepts of the layout of HTML code, as well as CSS. I found it interesting how seemingly simple the code seems to be, written in mostly plain English for "head", "body" or "font". This is definitely something that I'm interesting in exploring further, I'm just not far how far I could get in the limited time we have.
