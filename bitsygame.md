## Reflection: 
This was actually a really fun experiment that was quite satisfying to build and play around with. What I created was very basic but it was interesting to play with the character animation, and the dialogue. I think with this sort of thing, I would struggle to stay within the bounds of the program. I’ve never really played this sort of video game before (I don’t play a lot of video games at all), so I would struggle with a lot of basic concepts. I realise that I’m calling it a video game despite that being very much up for debate. Personally, I would lean more towards it being an interactive story, but just from the point of view of making the game itself, it’s obviously playing into the aesthetics, mechanics, and feeling of playing a video game. 
Regardless, I definitely would be interested to explore this program a little further, although I worry that something like this would just require quite a bit of time to fully realise.
