# Website Experiment 3

[Glitch Site](https://another-website-experiment.glitch.me/)

## Reflection
Getting a little more sophisticated here, I looked into complex heading and body structures, images and alts, document names, links, linking to a specific point in the webpage and Lorem Ipsum text. While still very basic, just doing these simple exercises has provided some great context for website design works, and how to build these basic sites. My aim to really go on to push the boundary and apply more complex effects and styles. While this will all very much depend on how much I’ll be able to learn and how much time I have, I know now that I can competently code a webpage with text where I want it, links and images. This will be the majority of what makes up my final project, so I’m confident I can take these skills and run with them.
