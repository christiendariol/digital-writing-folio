# Folio Reflections

## Deciding on an Idea
#### 1
I was initially completely lost for what to do for my final folio. I think a big issue with this assignment is that I have very little idea of what is feasible within the confines of the programs we’re using and what I can reasonably expect myself to learn in the time we have. Normally, how I like to work is to just start writing my piece before I really know what it will be. I have faith in my own process that I know something will come about if I just experiment enough. But with digital literature, I can’t really just start writing, as I first need to figure out the form my piece will take, what program I will use and various other factors before I even really begin. Its very hard to decide on an idea if I can’t even really be sure that a) it will turn out even remotely how I want it to and b) that I even have the skills/knowledge necessary to execute it. I’m afraid of working towards a specific idea and only finding out later that it’s something I can’t feasibly achieve with the time that I have, as I just don’t have experience to know how long these things take.

I really want to experiment with form with this assignment, as the most interesting aspect of studying digital literature has been the conceptual experimentation of many of the pieces. I’m excited by the possibilities at my disposal, but also feeling a lot of pressure to innovate. I usually thrive in the sort of environment where I’m free to pursue whatever form of creative work I want, but there’s just this massive barrier when it comes to digital literature and a complete lack of knowledge about what’s even possible in the time frame. Even the size of the work seems difficult to discern, as I can’t just go by a simple word count or anything like that.
