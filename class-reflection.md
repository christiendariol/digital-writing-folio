# Reflection on Class and Practice 
This class has opened up a huge volume of literary content I’d never been aware of, and provided many unique tools for producing these works. While there was tremendous enjoyment in learning about these forms and getting a chance to experiment with the programs, I struggled to really connect with many of the works of digital literature we looked at in class. 

This was most apparent when deciding on a work to present on for the first assignment. I went through many of the works to try to find a piece I connected with, and found that most of the pieces were highly inaccessible. This may be due to my own inexperience with the form, and perhaps the context of having to find a piece specifically to present further exacerbated this. 

The piece I eventually chose was UFO poems by Kevin Howbrook, a series of poems derived from UFO sightings, organised into the style of an E E Cummings poem. I enjoyed it mainly for its miraculous but genuine poetic value. 

I’m not a huge player of video games, so that may have contributed to my difficulty in connecting with many of the more interactive and game-like works we looked at, such as the works of Jason Nelson.

Still, for me to further connect with these works, I need to spend more time with them outside the context of  a class in my own time. I feel this would be highly for my practice, as there were many interesting ideas that came up throughout the semester that I never got the time to fully explore. Things like Oulipo, generative texts and much more were only given a brief window of exploration before moving on. 

My practice has developed tremendously throughout this semester, and I believe it will continue to do so once I get a chance to fo more solo exploration of electronic literature. 

This semester has opened so many new and varied ways of approaching storytelling and literature that I’d never really been exposed to before. This is something I will take with me beyond digital literature, and into my regular writing practice. One that has really intrigued me has been turninig my attention to how pieces are presented. This is something I don’t has really come up that much throughout the course, at least not to this extent. It’s opened up many ideas about what form particular pieces should take and what the best way to display them are. 

Lastly, I’ve walked away from this semester with a pretty good grasp of HTML and CSS, something I’ll hopefully have some user for in the future. While I don’t have much interest in web design, I’d like to explore more with the presentation of works of literature over digital mediiums.
