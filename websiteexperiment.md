# Another Experiment Website

[Glitch Link](https://website-experiment.glitch.me/)

## Reflection
This website played a bit more with backgrounds and links. This taught me basic concepts surrounding CSS and how to make webpages look the way I wanted them to. Again, still at a pretty basic level, but my aim here is get as solid a grasp on the basics as possible so that I can build on the particular field Iâ€™m interesed in.
