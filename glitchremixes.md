## Reflection
This includes the application of ‘To Make a Dadaist Poem’, a 1920 piece by Tristan Tzara providing instructions on making a poem in dadaist style. It also includes poem remixes.
Similar to N+7, the idea of applying a systematic method to a literary work to create something new out of existing material. I definitely want to investigate that as an idea further. Even just the idea of found material would be interesting to play with in digital literature. I’ve never really considered works of found literature before, but there is something in its application as digital literature that I really enjoy. In class, we’ve also played around with N-Grams and the [jGnoetry](http://www.eddeaddad.net/jGnoetry/) site, that generates poems based on pre-existing source texts such as novels, poems, or news articles. It was a lot to keep track of in the end, and it can be hard to discern what I should explore further in the time we have. I think I like the idea of generated text, especially endlessly recurring ones like Tarako Gorge, but it would need some other element I think to make it interesting.
