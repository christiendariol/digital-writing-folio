## Reflection
This was a test run of using the interactive/hypertext fiction program Twine. I created a brief story called 'Smoke in the Auditorium'. This was quite a bit to take in at once. Not only have I never used Twine or any similar such program, but I have very little experience written hypertext fiction or a choose-your-own-adventure story. There are things I found interesting about both. First, creating interactive fiction presents many unique challenges. You realise just how quickly you accumulate different branching stories, and keeping track of everything as you go can be very challenging. It does make me wonder how these types of stories work, given that after about three or fourn choices, you’ve now created up five or six separate storylines, which is already quite a lot to keep track of. Multiply this by the full length of the story and you have an astronomical amount of branches to your single narrative and character, even if you join separate stories together at some point, it’s hard to keep the game interactive throughout and not just have a single option for each page. It is an interesting way to write stories, though. I realise that it might be a useful tool for constructing the narrative world of a linear story, as it naturally forces you to think outside the box and what other choices are possible for your character. 
The program itself was straightforward enough to use. I did have quite a few issues with adding images, but I seemed to have resolved this in the end.  
Albeit interesting, there was quite a bit I found frustrating about using Twine and getting certain elements to work. I look forward to exploring this further.
