# Word Puzzles (Unused)

This was one of my first ideas for the project that I began working on. I've decided to include them here as I managed to get pretty far before changing my mind, and it was also a highly instructive experiment moving forward with my actual idea. 

It's a series of riddles where the user has to guess the answer, usually a single word, by looking for clues in the lines.

   ## Reflection: 
   This is my first working idea for my final folio project. I really like the idea of it, and I feel there’s some good stuff in what I’ve already put together. I would have to have to good, long think about how I want to the piece to be structured and presented, and whether I want it to have some overarching narrative, or even just a running theme. The current issue with the puzzles is that they may be slightly too difficult. While I could get away with producing difficult puzzles, I just don’t want to retract from the actual literary value of the work. There comes a point where I have to worry about accessibility of the work if the puzzles are just too obscure. I’m using a lot of language and techniques from cryptic crosswords, which a lot of readers will be completely unfamiliar with. 
I think going forward I need to think a bit more about audience, structure and presentation if I’m going to look at this idea further.
