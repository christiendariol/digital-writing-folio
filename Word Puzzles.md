# Word Puzzles (Unused)

This was one of my first ideas for the project that I began working on. I've decided to include them here as I managed to get pretty far before changing my mind, and it was also a highly instructive experiment moving forward with my actual idea. 

It's a series of riddles where the user has to guess the answer, usually a single word, by looking for clues in the lines.
