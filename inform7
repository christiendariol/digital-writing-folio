 ## Reflection
I found similar frustrations with this program as I did with the actual works of interactive fiction that we looked at, such as ‘Shade’. It definitely seems like this would take a lot more time and dedication to learn how to do really anything creative with it. I really like the idea itself, I do feel there could be a lot of possibilities in the idea of users having to input commands to progress a story. However, I worry for a program like this that it would perpetually bound you within the confines of the program, and would never really allow you to extend far outside what it wants you to do. 
I would like to explore this a little further, but I doubt I’ll be using this for my final project. 
As a side note, it seems that the netlify that I was initially viewing this on is no longer working. Not sure why, and I don’t really have the time here to troubleshoot. The original code will all still be in the repository.
